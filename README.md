Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

The user will be prompted to choose from the following password criteria:

* Length (between 8 and 128 characters)
* Character type:
    * Uppercase Letters
    * Lowercase Letters
    * Numbers
    * Special Characters

This application should validate user input and ensure that at least one character type is selected.
